# Bones Out!

---

###### A puzzle game about the escape of a skeleton from the dungeons of the inquisition

This game was written during the ASAP GAMES SCHOOL 2022 game development school, held at FEFU from March 24 to April 30. My first experience of game programming (zero is not worth considering).

In the team, I played the role of the only programmer.
